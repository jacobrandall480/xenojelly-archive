# XENOJELLY ARCHIVE

## About This Project

This is an interactive 3D web experience that transforms trans literary and theoretical texts into a living underwater archive. Rather than simply presenting quotes in a static format, the project enacts the theoretical concepts it contains—jellyfish entities pulse, split, transform, and leave ghostly traces, refusing classification and embodying trans temporality.

From Saidiya Hartman's "Venus in Two Acts":
> "This double gesture can be described as straining against the limits of the archive to write a cultural history of the captive, and, at the same time, enacting the impossibility of representing the lives of the captives precisely through the process of narration."


## How to Experience It

**[→ Launch the project](https://jacobrandall480.github.io/xenojelly-archive/archive.html)** 

Or run locally:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `archive.html` in a web browser
3. Click "ENTER THE BORDERLAND OCEAN" to begin
4. Navigate using mouse and keyboard controls

## What to Expect

- **30+ bioluminescent jellyfish** in trans flag colors (blue, pink, white)
- **Three distinct species** with different tentacle morphologies and behaviors
- **Text fragments** from trans scholarship, poetry, and manifestos
- **Interactive transformations**: click jellyfish to trigger split or molt events
- **Dynamic kinship networks**: 
  - Persistent sibling bonds form when jellyfish split, connecting chosen family across distance
  - Proximity-based constellations emerge when same-type jellyfish swim near each other
  - Watch pink, blue, and white jellyfish create living maps of trans affinity and recognition
- **Husk afterlives**: ghostly remains that continue to pulse and glow
- **Corrupted field notes**: classification attempts that perpetually fail
- **Ambient soundscape**: underwater audio with whale calls and transformation sounds

Do not expect traditional archival stability—this system is designed to leak, glitch, and refuse capture. 

## Navigation Controls

**Mouse:**
- **Hover** over jellyfish to reveal text fragments and corrupted field notes
- **Click** jellyfish to trigger split or transformation events
- **Drag** to orbit camera perspective through the ocean

**Keyboard:**
- **W / S keys** — Move camera inward/outward (zoom through the swarm)
- **Arrow keys ↑ / ↓** — Rise or descend through water column
- **Arrow keys ← / →** — Rotate left/right around archive center

## Interaction Events

**Split Event:**
- A jellyfish divides into two offspring
- Creates persistent kinship lines (glowing connections)
- Accompanied by archival/fabulated quote pairs
- Represents trans kinship beyond biological reproduction

**Transform/Molt Event:**
- A jellyfish sheds its current form (becomes a husk)
- Emerges in new morphology with different text fragments
- Represents trans becoming and refusal of fixed categories
- Original form continues as ghostly presence

**Husk Afterlife:**
- Discarded forms drift downward slowly
- Leave particle trails and periodic pulses
- Not endings but lingering presences
- Visualizes trans temporality and relationship with past selves

## Technical Details

**Built with:**
- Three.js (r128) for WebGL 3D rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- HTML5/CSS3 for UI elements
- Procedural animation systems
- Web Audio API for soundscape

**Key Features:**
- 30+ jellyfish entities with species-specific morphologies
- Real-time mutation and transformation systems
- Kinship line visualization (persistent connections between entities)
- Husk afterlife particles (ghostly remains that continue pulsing)
- Marine snow particle system (1400+ particles)
- Border seam visualization (shimmering vertical planes in trans flag colors)
- Interactive hover system with corrupted field notes
- Whisper system (ambient text fragments that drift across screen)
- Quote particle system (archival/fabulated pairs during transformation events)
- Ambient ocean soundscape with whale calls
- Event-triggered audio (split and transformation sounds)

## Concept

This project explores:
- How archives perform fixity and how they might perform mutability instead
- What happens when documents refuse classification
- The relationship between trans theory and oceanic space
- Opacity as resistance to extractive knowledge systems
- Kinship beyond biological reproduction
- The afterlife of discarded selves

By making trans scholarship interactive and embodied, the project argues that some concepts—fugitivity, fungibility, opacity, porous flesh—are better understood through experience than through reading alone. The breakdown of archival stability mirrors the theoretical work these texts perform.
